**#Used Device resale Category Classification, Normalized Used Price Prediction and Recommendations**

BIG_C, an e-commerce company specializing in selling used devices with high resale value, faces bankruptcy due to three key reasons. First, it's hard to predict whether a device will have a high or low resale value, as many factors affect it. Second, BIG_C struggles to determine the current market value of the devices, leading to overspending when buying stock. Thirdly, the limited availability of used devices frequently results in customers being unable to find their desired items, leading to loss of customers for the business. To improve profits, the company decided to use predictive and clustering analyses on historical data. The backward selection logistic regression model was selected as the best model to classify whether a used device has high resale value or not, allowing BIG_C to purchase only devices classified as having high resale value instead of buying all used devices. The regression tree model was chosen as the best model to predict the market value of used devices, preventing the company from overinvesting in devices that would lead to decreased profits. Cluster analysis is used to group used devices with high resale value and recommend similar devices to customers if their preferred item is unavailable. Knn model is considered as the best model to assign a used device to a cluster.
